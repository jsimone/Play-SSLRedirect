# Heroku SSL Redirect Module

This is a module for the Play 2.0 framework. It will make it easy for you to make https the default transport for your app. It works by checking the X-FORWARDED-PROTO header in requests and redirecting them to the https version of the requested page if the original request was not https.

## Usage

## Heroku

X-FORWARDED-PROTO is the primary means of SSL detection when running on the Heroku platform so the SSL redirect module will work seamlessly with Heroku apps.

## Contributions

I'm very open to contributions. If you need some other means of detecting for SSL feel free to send me a pull request with the additional functionality.
